### About me

Hi, my name is Dominik Peter -> 50 % tech nerd, 50 % outdoorsman, 10 %....robot.
I am a Data Analyst by passion and by profession who lives in beautiful Switzerland. As a matter of fact, we have so many publicly available datasets, it's a dream for any data enthusiast*. By the way, Switzerland is not just worth a look because of it's open data policy. 

### About my blog

This blog is my personal playground to try new things and get some interesting insights.
I like to play around with data and theories, as you will see while reading the blog. I highly belief that you have to get your hands dirty while working with data and that is exactly what this blog is about.

The tools I will be using in this blog are R, Python and hopfully some Scala in the future -or whatever hot new technologie is right around the corner.

### Disclaimer

All the source code of the entire blog is available on [Github](https://github.com/dominikpeter/dominikpeter.github.io).
