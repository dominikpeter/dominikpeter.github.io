Welcome to my blog.

My name is Dominik. I am a Data Analyst -by passion and by profession- located in beautiful Switzerland.
We have so many publicly available datasets, it's a dream for any data enthusiast. If you are interested, check out [OpenData](https://opendata.swiss/en/).

This blog is my personal playground to try new things and get some interesting insights.
I like to play around with data and theories, as you will see while reading the blog. I highly belief that you have to get your hands dirty while working with data and that is exactly what this blog is about.

All the source code of the entire blog is available on [Github](https://github.com/dominikpeter/dominikpeter.github.io).
The blog is fully open source and you can do with it whatever you want.
