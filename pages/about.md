Hi, my name is <mark>Dominik Peter.</mark>

I am a Data Analyst by passion and by profession who lives in beautiful <mark>Switzerland.</mark> As a matter of fact, we have so many publicly available datasets, it's a dream for any data enthusiast. By the way, Switzerland is not just worth a look because of it's open data policy.<i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>

This blog is my personal playground to try new things and get some interesting insights.
I like to play around with data and theories, as you will see while reading the blog. I highly belief that you have to get your hands dirty while working with data and that is exactly what this blog is about.

The tools I will be using in this blog are <mark>R, Python, eventually some Scala</mark>, or whatever hot new technologie is right around the corner.

All the source code of the entire blog is available on [Github](https://github.com/dominikpeter/dominikpeter.github.io).
The blog is fully open source and you can do with it whatever you want.
I won't be responsible for any damage it may cause when reusing some of the code. In return, I won't ask you any money if you somehow achive to make a fortune out of it.
